description: Draft recruiter outreach (email or LinkedIn) from HIRING.md and the candidate card. Never send. Use when the user wants first-touch or follow-up copy.

# draft-outreach

Draft outreach only. Do not send email, LinkedIn, or ATS messages.

Write the draft onto the focused req's candidate card (`candidates/<id>.md` body, Outreach section). Never create `candidates/` at company root when reqs are subdirectories.

## Discover inputs

1. User-attached paths / pasted notes
2. Focused packet: that req's `HIRING.md`, `candidates/<id>.md`
3. Prior score on the card or in the conversation if present

## Clarify channel

Default to a short email + optional LinkedIn DM variant unless the user specifies one.

## Write the draft (required)

After the chat preview, write the full markdown into an Outreach section on `candidates/<id>.md`. Create the card if it does not exist.

Chat may show the same draft; the card is the source of truth. You are not done until the file is written (unless the workspace is read-only or the user forbade writes).

## Output format

```markdown
# Outreach draft: <candidate> · <role>

## Email
Subject: ...

Body:
...

## LinkedIn (optional)
...

## Personalization hooks
- Facts from the card / HIRING.md used (with paths)

## Open questions
- Missing sender/company details still needed
```

## Rules

- No fake claims about comp, team, or process not in materials
- Keep under ~150 words for first touch unless asked for longer
- Never call send APIs or claim a message was delivered
- If candidate contact is missing, draft body and note that recipient is unset
